# BlockChain Network Framework Implementaion 
This project aims to implement the core blockchain network protocol using both gRPC and Muduo network libraries. The focus is on simplifying the underlying network mechanisms of blockchain technology while avoiding the complexity of high-concurrency and intensive computational scenarios. 

Based on the [Bitcoin white paper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) and [Bitcoin RPC](https://developer.bitcoin.org/reference/rpc/index.html) as references, the project is organized into several business modules:

## Core Blockchain Module

## Mining Module
* Scenario Description:
Manages essential blockchain functionalities, including block retrieval and transaction operations. 

### [RPC APIs]()

## Mining Module 
* Scenario Description: 
Interfaces with mining tasks to generate blocks and manage mining operations. 

### [RPC APIs]()



## Network Management Module 
* Scenario Description: 
Manages connections and network-related operations with other nodes. 

### [RPC APIs]()


## Wallet Management Module 
* Scenario Description: 
Handles wallet functionalities such as address management and transaction processing. 

### [RPC APIs]()

## Transaction Management Module 
* Scenario Description: 
Manages raw transactions, including signing and broadcasting. 


### [RPC APIs]()


## Analytics and Reporting Module 
* Scenario Description:
Provides insights and analytics on the blockchain state and transaction metrics. 


### [RPC APIs]()


## Utility Module
* Scenario Description:
Offers utility functions like address validation and fee estimation. 

### [RPC APIs]()


This project aims to provide a clear and structured implementation of blockchain network protocols while maintaining an easy-to-understand approach. Contributions and suggestions for improvement are welcome!
